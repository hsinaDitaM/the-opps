## Planned Meals
> The Alpine lodge extra-large kitchen seats 44 people.  The kitchens are perfect for large group meals and all come equipped with appropriate appliances and utensils. There is an outdoor barbecue!  There is a fridge and individual kitchens in the homes.   So there is a place to store snacks, make sure you stock up for the little ones.

1. **Breakfast** will be available at 8am each morning. Families will be able to serve themselves and we ask that you clean up after yourselves as well. Breakfast will close at 9:30 to allow time for clean up before activities begin.
2.  **Morning Huddle** will be at 9:45am in the dinning hall.  This is a chance to know what the activities are and where you need to be if you are participating.
3.  **Lunch** will be available at 12pm each day.  Supplies will be available to make your own lunch.  You can dine in the hall or take it with you depending on planned activities.  As always clean up after yourself and your family.  
4.  **Dinner** will be available at 6pm each evening. It is strongly encouraged to eat in the hall all together so that you do not miss the 7pm Family Night directly afterwards.
- **NOTE** - The menu for the day will be posted in the dinning hall each morning. Snacks will be left out after lunch and if any remain will be put away when dinner is being prepared.
